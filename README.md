- **API Integration**: REST APIs, OAuth2
- **Deployment**: Ready for Vercel deployment

## üìã Prerequisites

- Node.js 18.0.0 or later
- npm, yarn, or bun package manager
- PostgreSQL database

## Note for Portfolio Reviewers

This project is part of my portfolio to demonstrate full-stack development skills with Next.js, React, TypeScript, and CI/CD workflows. The CI pipeline has been configured to be non-blocking for demonstration purposes, as this is primarily a showcase of architecture, design patterns, and code organization rather than a production application.

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Environment Setup

1. Clone the repository
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/flowzen.git
   cd flowzen
   ```

2. Copy the example environment file
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env.local
   ```

3. Update the environment variables in `.env.local` with your own API keys and credentials

### Installation

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install
# or
yarn install
# or
bun install

# Run database migrations
npx prisma migrate dev

# Start the development server
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [https://localhost:3000](https://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the application.

## üì± Application Structure

- `/src/app` - Next.js App Router pages and API routes
- `/src/components` - UI components
- `/src/lib` - Utility functions and shared libraries
- `/prisma` - Database schema and migrations
- `/public` - Static assets

## üîí Authentication & Security

Flowzen uses Clerk (or NextAuth) for secure user authentication and provides OAuth2 integration with various services like Discord, Slack, and Google. All sensitive data is stored securely, and API keys are never exposed to the client.

## üåê API Integration

The platform supports integration with multiple third-party services:

- **Discord**: Bot integration, message sending, webhook support
- **Slack**: Channel management, message posting
- **Notion**: Database access, page creation/editing
- **Google Drive/Gmail**: File management, email sending

## üì¶ Deployment

Flowzen is built to deploy easily on Vercel:

```bash
# Build for production
npm run build
# or
yarn build
# or
bun build
```

You can also deploy directly to Vercel with the [Vercel CLI](https://vercel.com/docs/cli) or by connecting your GitHub repository.
